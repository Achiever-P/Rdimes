A visually captivating gaming website built using React and Tailwind CSS, inspired by the elegant and modern design principles of Zentry. This project showcases advanced animations, a luxurious aesthetic, and smooth user interactions, tailored for gaming enthusiasts.

Technologies Used
React: For building dynamic and reusable components, ensuring a smooth user interface.
Tailwind CSS: To style the website with a modern, responsive, and minimalist design.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For creating advanced animations, including scroll-triggered effects and animated titles.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
